The SecAI Research module provides a platform for querying and analyzing IP and domain intelligence. Users can retrieve information such as verdicts, threat labels, historical activity, and various metadata related to an address.

## How to Use?

### 1. Searching for an IP or Domain
- Enter an IP address or domain in the search bar.
- Click Search to view the intelligence results.
- The results include verdicts, tags, Whois, attack history, passive DNS, certificates, and more.

### 2. Get Instant Threat Verdicts
Each queried IP or domain receives a verdict indicating its security status:
- **Malicious** – Associated with known threats or attacks.
- **Suspicious** – Exhibits behavior that may indicate risk.
- **Benign** – No detected malicious activity.
- **Unknown** – Insufficient data available.

The verdict is determined based on rule-based detection.

Also, SecAI integrates well-known external intelligence providers to enhance accuracy like VirusTotal, Greynoise and urlscan, etc. Users can configure third-party API keys in the Integration settings to unlock additional verdicts and enrich their analysis with external intelligence sources.

### 3.Investigate with Threat Intelligence Labels
Each IP or domain comes with automated intelligence labels that categorize its risk profile.Including but not limited to the following categories:
- **Threat Attribution:** Identifies links to APT groups, botnets, or malware campaigns.
- **Infrastructure Role:** Determines whether the entity is a C2 server, proxy, VPN, or residential IP.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Detects use in phishing, DDoS attacks, or credential stuffing operations.

These tags help you quickly assess risk and determine next steps.

### 4. Multi-Dimensional Data
SecAI aggregates intelligence data to provide a comprehensive view of an address. The available data includes, but is not limited to:
- **Whois & Registration History** – Domain ownership and changes over time.
- **Passive DNS (pDNS)** – Historical DNS resolutions linking domains and IPs.
- **Certificate**  – SSL/TLS certificate relationships.
- **Port Scans & Service Banners** – Information from global scanning data.
- **Related Malware Files** – Identified threats communicating with the address.
- **Historical Activity** – Previously observed attack methods, targeted ports/services, and connections to other infrastructure.
- **Web Search Results** – Extracted data from indexed webpages associated with the address.

This information allows for deeper analysis and correlation across different data points.

## Accessing Research Data
Currently, SecAI Research is accessible through:
- **Web Interface** – Users can perform manual searches via the platform.
- **API Integration (Coming Soon)** – Support for automated queries.
- **Feeds (Coming Soon)** – Continuous intelligence updates for external integration.

These options provide flexibility in how intelligence is accessed and utilized.

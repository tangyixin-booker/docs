SecAI offers key capabilities for analyzing IPs and domains across threat detection and investigation scenarios. The platform combines structured data, threat context, behavior history, and AI-based interpretation to support efficient security workflows.

## Verdicts
SecAI assigns a risk verdict to each queried IP or domain, categorized as malicious, suspicious, benign, or unknown. Verdicts are determined through a rule-based system built on internal and external intelligence sources, including intels, historical behaviors, and more contextual data.
The verdict provides an immediate judgment of the entity’s risk level and can serves as a reference for processes such as alert validation, IOC management, and policy response.

## Contexts
Each entity is enriched with threat labels and supporting contextual data to help analysts understand its role and potential threat associations.
Tag categories include:
- Threat categories
- Network Information
- Inbound Activities & Contexts
- Malware 
- Attribution to APT or eCrime groups
- Involvement in known attack campaigns
Context includes data such as Whois, DNS records, certificates, malware samples, cybermapping, and web indexing. Both SecAI’s internal intelligence and third-party data sources are integrated and normalized.

## Historical Activities
SecAI maintains a record of historical attack-related activity for IP addresses. This includes observed attack techniques, targeted ports and services, behavioral patterns, and reuse of infrastructure over time.
This capability can be used to identify persistent threats, infrastructure reuse, and attack trend patterns.

## Data Aggregation
SecAI aggregates and standardizes data from multiple third-party intelligence platforms, scanning systems, reputation sources, and public search engines, presenting them in a unified format within query results.
Users can also link their API keys via the Integration module to access more comprehensive external intelligence and enhance the completeness and reliability of their analysis.

## Insight Summary
This module provides AI-generated summaries and judgments based on multi-dimensional inputs related to an IP or domain. It integrates:
- Intelligence tags and metadata
- Web search and indexing information
- Phishing detection
- Certificate, historical behaviors and more contextual information
The AI model synthesizes these data sources to offer a structured interpretation of the indicator and gives a corresponding judgment aligned with the underlying evidence.
